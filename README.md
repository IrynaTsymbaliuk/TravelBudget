### Project status: in progress.

### Features:
- Language: Kotlin
- Single-Activity Architecture
- Android Jetpack (Navigation, Room, LiveData, ViewModel)
- Firebase authentication (with Google)
- ViewPager with RecyclerView

### Install:
For security, I left default web client id in LoginManager class. To configure authentication, pass server's client ID to the requestIdToken method.

### Usage (planned):
"Travel budget" is designed for manual input of all costs. With this app calculates daily budget. It is convenient for trips, irregular income or frequent change of currencies, not suitable for people who prefer cashless payments.
