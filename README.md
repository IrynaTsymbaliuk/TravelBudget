### Project status: in progress.

### Features:
- Language: Kotlin
- Single-Activity Architecture
- Android Jetpack (Navigation, Room, LiveData)
- Firebase authentication (with Google)

### Install:
For security, I left default web client id in LoginManager class. To configure authentication, pass your server's client ID to the requestIdToken method. To find the OAuth 2.0 client ID:
1. Open the Credentials page in the GCP Console.
2. The Web application type client ID is your backend server's OAuth 2.0 client ID.

### Usage (planned):
Travel budget calculates daily budget. This app is designed for manual input of all costs. App is convenient for trips, irregular income or frequent change of currencies, not suitable for people who prefer cashless payments.
